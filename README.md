# Lampix App Starter

Minimal boilerplate to help get started with Lampix apps.  
It does not assume the technologies that will be used.

## Installation

`git clone --depth=1 git@gitlab.rosoftlab.net:lampix/lampix-app-starter.git`  
`cd lampix-app-starter`  
`npm install`

If you're not improving the boilerplate, but rather starting a new app, go ahead and remove the `.git` folder.

### Features

### CSS Modules

This helps with keeping CSS maintainable as you'll be writing CSS for specific components, while avoiding name collisions automatically.
By default, CSS modules are disabled. You can enable them by adding a `.env` file at the root of the project and specifying `CSS_MODULES_ENABLED=1`.


### HMR

Helps speed up development as you won't have to manually reload all the time for the slightest of changes (this works both in the browser and in the simulator since the content is served via the WebpackDevServer).

Other features are on their way, and you are more than welcome to create an issue or a pull request for them.

### Sourcemaps

Sourcemaps are enabled by default for the development environment.

### Usage

#### Developing

`src/index.js` is defined as the entry point of the application. You do not need to add scripts to `index.html`. As long as any dependency in the dependency tree connects to the root (`src/index.js`) directly or indirectly, Webpack will bundle the dependencies correctly. That means you should import ANY dependencies, including `json` files, images, CSS files and the whatever else you might need.

With the above in mind, get started developing by running `npm start` and going to the specified URL.

#### Production

`npm run build` will output the `dist` directory with a flattened file structure and paths to them updated automatically and accordingly in your code.

## Contributing

Open an issue first to discuss potential changes/additions.  
We'd like to the `master` branch minimal, but we can definitely have branches specific for environments using SASS, LESS, Stylus, JSX, TypeScript etc.
